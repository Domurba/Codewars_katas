"""Yes it's Fibonacci yet again ! But this time it's SQL.

You need to create a select statement which will produce first 90 Fibonnacci numbers. The column name is - `number`

Fibbonaccii sequence is:
```
Â 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..., 89, 144, 233, 377, ...
```
where 
```
f(0) = 0
f(1) = 1
...
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
```

Have fun!"""
